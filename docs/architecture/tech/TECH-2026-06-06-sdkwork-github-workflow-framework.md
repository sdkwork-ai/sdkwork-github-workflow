**Goal:** Build a reusable GitHub Actions workflow framework that standardizes SDKWork application packaging across server, desktop, mobile, web, and container targets.

**Architecture:** Applications declare `sdkwork.workflow.json`; this framework validates the config, resolves matrices, checks out dependencies, sets up toolchains, runs lifecycle commands, and publishes artifacts through a reusable workflow. The core logic lives in a tested zero-dependency Node planner rather than copied YAML.

**Tech Stack:** GitHub Actions reusable workflows, composite actions, Node ESM, JSON Schema, Node test runner.
