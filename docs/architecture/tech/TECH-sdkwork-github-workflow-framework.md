## Problem

SDKWork applications need to be committed to Git and packaged or deployed through GitHub Actions. If every application authors its own workflow, packaging logic fragments quickly:

- Matrix definitions drift across repositories.
- Dependency checkout logic is copied and hard to audit.
- Desktop, server, mobile, and container package formats use different conventions.
- Release upload, artifact retention, and validation policies become inconsistent.
- Security posture depends on the habits of each repository.

The `sdkwork-cloudrouter` workflow demonstrates the required capability set, but it mixes framework concerns and application-specific build commands in one YAML file.

## Recommended Architecture

Use an independent reusable workflow repository:

- Application repositories own `sdkwork.workflow.json`.
- Application repositories keep a thin workflow entrypoint that calls `sdkwork-ai/sdkwork-github-workflow/.github/workflows/sdkwork-package.yml@v1`.
- This framework owns reusable orchestration and composite actions.
- Application-specific build/package/validate commands are declared as lifecycle steps.

This follows the current GitHub Actions reusable workflow model and avoids vendoring large workflow files into every application.

## Core Components

### Configuration Schema

`schemas/sdkwork-workflow.schema.json` defines the application contract:

- `app`: app id, repository, source path.
- `release`: artifact prefix and default version.
- `dependencies`: repository, ref input, checkout path, token secret, submodule mode.
- `toolchains`: Node, pnpm, Python, Java, Go, Rust, Flutter, Android, Xcode, WiX.
- `lifecycle`: preflight, install, build, stage, package, validate, publish command phases.
- `targets`: deployment profile, runtime target, package profile, platform, architecture, formats, runner, output globs.
- `security`: OIDC, attestations, SBOM, signing flags.
- `publish`: workflow artifact and GitHub Release settings.

For every deployable target the planner derives evidence paths and upload globs.
The reusable workflow verifies those documents after the application validate
phase, uploads them with the package, and verifies the downloaded artifact bytes
again in each deployment job. `evidence:create` is the shared helper for hashing
the primary artifact and writing the canonical JSON document.

### Planner CLI

`scripts/sdkwork-workflow.mjs` is a zero-dependency Node tool used by tests and workflows.

It provides:

- `validate`: validates config.
- `matrix`: builds the GitHub Actions matrix.
- `dependencies`: builds dependency checkout metadata.
- `lifecycle`: renders or executes a lifecycle phase for a target.

The planner is intentionally outside YAML so matrix logic can be tested.

### Reusable Workflow

`.github/workflows/sdkwork-package.yml` has four job roles:

- `plan`: checks out app and framework, validates config, resolves matrix, resolves dependencies.
- `package`: runs per target, checks out app/framework/dependencies, sets up toolchains, runs lifecycle phases, verifies evidence, uploads scoped workflow artifacts, attests provenance, uploads release assets.
- `publish`: when aggregate Release is enabled, downloads only `sdkwork-publishable-*` artifacts, runs finalization, and uploads configured assets once.
- `deploy`: downloads one selected publishable package, revalidates evidence, binds a GitHub Environment, and runs deploy/publish lifecycle side effects.

### Composite Actions

- `actions/validate-config`
- `actions/checkout-dependencies`
- `actions/setup-toolchains`
- `actions/run-lifecycle`
- `actions/publish-release`

Composite actions keep the main workflow readable and reusable.

## Target Model

The framework keeps deployment architecture, runtime location, and package taxonomy separate.

Deployment profiles are:

- `standalone`
- `cloud`

Runtime targets are:

- `browser`
- `desktop`
- `tablet-ipados`
- `tablet-android`
- `capacitor-ios`
- `capacitor-android`
- `flutter-ios`
- `flutter-android`
- `android-native`
- `ios-native`
- `harmony-native`
- `mini-program`
- `server`
- `container`
- `test-runner`

Package profiles are:

- `server`
- `desktop`
- `mobile`
- `tablet`
- `browser`
- `mini-program`
- `container`
- `worker`
- `library`
- `test`

The framework supports these platforms:

- `web`
- `h5`
- `h5-weixin`
- `linux`
- `windows`
- `macos`
- `android`
- `android-tablet`
- `ios`
- `ipados`
- `windows-tablet`
- `harmony`
- `container`
- `mp-weixin`
- `mp-alipay`
- `mp-baidu`
- `mp-toutiao`
- `mp-lark`
- `mp-qq`
- `mp-kuaishou`
- `mp-jd`
- `mp-360`
- `mp-dingtalk`
- `mp-ali`
- `test`

The framework supports these architectures:

- `x64`
- `arm64`
- `armv7`
- `universal`
- `wasm32`
- `noarch`

The framework supports these package formats:

- Archive: `zip`, `tar.gz`
- Linux native: `deb`, `rpm`, `appimage`, `snap`, `flatpak`
- macOS native: `pkg`, `dmg`
- Windows native: `msi`, `msix`, `exe`
- Container: `docker`, `oci`, `helm`
- Mobile: `apk`, `aab`, `ipa`
- Tablet: `apk`, `aab`, `ipa`, `msix`
- Browser/mini-program/JVM: `web`, `web-url`, `static`, `mini-program-package`, `jar`, `war`

Package targets declare `profileBinding = fixed|runtime-configurable|non-deployable`.
Fixed targets use `<platform>-<architecture>-<deployment-profile>-<profile>-<format-token>`.
Runtime-configurable client targets are built once with a `dual` package token,
declare both supported profiles, and select one active profile only at runtime or
deployment. Non-deployable `test-runner` targets use the `test` binding token and
never enter publication or deployment selectors. Linux native `deb` and `rpm`
packages insert the distribution segment after `linux`. Docker-compatible
artifacts use `runtimeTarget = "container"` and a container format such as `oci`
or `docker`; `docker` is not a deployment profile, runtime target, or package
profile. Deployment matrix items always carry a resolved `artifactEvidencePath`
so the deployment lifecycle can verify immutable evidence before side effects.

## Migration From sdkwork-cloudrouter

The original workflow contains these framework-level concepts:

- Git tag and release triggers for standard package/deploy entrypoints.
- `workflow_dispatch` inputs for tag/version/deployment profile/runtime target/platform/architecture/profile/format.
- Matrix planner.
- Dependency repository checkout.
- Node/pnpm/Python/Rust/WiX setup.
- Application build.
- Staging.
- Native/archive package generation.
- Artifact validation.
- Artifact upload.
- GitHub Release upload.

The example `examples/sdkwork-cloudrouter/sdkwork.workflow.json` maps these into:

- `dependencies` for appbase/core/ui/im-sdk/sdk-generator.
- `toolchains` for Node, pnpm, Python, Rust, and WiX.
- lifecycle commands for install, build, stage, package, and validate.
- lifecycle commands for sign, sbom, deploy, and publish.
- targets for Linux, Windows, macOS, desktop/server/container packages.
- deployments for production server rollout and desktop/mobile store publishing.

The per-application workflow shrinks to a reusable workflow call with standardized tag push, release publish, and manual dispatch triggers.

## Standards Alignment

The design aligns with current GitHub Actions practices:

- Reusable workflows for centralized orchestration.
- Composite actions for reusable local workflow steps.
- Minimal explicit permissions.
- `id-token: write` for OIDC-capable deployment actions.
- Artifact attestations with build provenance.
- Toolchain setup consumes every declared planner output, including .NET, Android SDK, and Xcode.
- Policy validation that turns required signing and SBOM declarations into mandatory lifecycle hooks.
- GitHub Environments for deployment approvals, URLs, and environment-scoped secrets.
- `concurrency` to prevent accidental overlapping releases.
- `actions/checkout@v4`, setup actions, and artifact v4.
- Matrix generation in code with tests instead of duplicated YAML.
- Shell-based actions read workflow/action inputs from environment variables before command execution.

## Error Handling

- Config validation fails before package jobs start.
- Planner validation rejects schema-declared type mismatches, empty target lists, duplicate target formats, and unsupported fields before matrix jobs are created.
- Required signing and SBOM policies fail validation if their lifecycle hooks are missing.
- Matrix selection fails if filters select no targets.
- Dependency checkout fails on missing repository/path/ref.
- Dependency checkout path overlaps with the application source or framework checkout fail validation before checkout.
- Dependency ref JSON workflow input is passed through an environment variable before shell execution.
- Deployment selectors that match no package target fail validation before deployment matrix generation.
- Lifecycle execution stops on the first failed step.
- Deployment jobs are optional and only run when the caller passes `deploy: true`.
- Deployment jobs bind to the configured GitHub Environment.
- Upload steps use `if-no-files-found: error`.
- Application-specific package validation remains a mandatory lifecycle phase for production-grade apps.
- Publication and provenance steps are driven by resolved config policy as well as caller inputs: `publish.workflowArtifact`, `publish.githubRelease`, `publish.retentionDays`, and `security.artifactAttestations` must affect the reusable workflow execution path.
- Deployment lifecycle execution receives deployment environment, URL, and lifecycle values explicitly so local lifecycle plans and GitHub deployment jobs share the same context contract.

## Tradeoffs

Dynamic lifecycle commands cannot use GitHub's native `uses:` syntax because Actions does not support dynamically generated steps. The framework therefore rejects lifecycle `uses:` entries and executes declared `run` commands through a controlled Node runner. Shared workflow behavior that genuinely needs `uses:` remains in framework-level composite actions.

Application-specific package builders stay in application repositories. This keeps the framework generic and avoids embedding assumptions about Tauri, Flutter, Gradle, Docker, Helm, or custom SDKWork packaging internals.
